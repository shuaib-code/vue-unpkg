# Learning Vue.js with CDN

This simple project demonstrates the basics of using Vue.js by directly including it in an HTML file via a Content Delivery Network (CDN). This approach is excellent for quick prototyping, learning the core concepts of Vue, or embedding small Vue components into existing static websites without a complex build process.

## What's Included

- **`index.html`**: A basic HTML file that includes the Vue.js library from a CDN.
- **`main.js`**: Contains a simple Vue application.
- **`style.css`**: Basic styling for index.html .

## How to Run

**Open `index.html` in your web browser.** That's it! Since we're using a CDN, you don't need any special setup or server. Your browser will fetch the Vue.js library directly from the CDN.
